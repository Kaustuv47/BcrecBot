Introduction

This is python based Chat Bot for fetching Notice from NoticeBoard of a College or institution.
Once the date are fetched then the file links are sent back to Telegram Chat Bot, 
For having the code runable one need to have a Telegram Chat bot ID and the a unique Chat Id of a person or Group.

Version 1
There of two versions available for the task, version 1 is having a bunch of issue and I suggest not to use this. Though you can have a look to the code.

Version 2
It is working prototype and is currently in use. Here some changes like 
  notice board webpage url
  Chat id or Group id
  Url of Group
